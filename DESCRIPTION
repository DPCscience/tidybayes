Description: Facilitates composing data for and gathering samples from
    Bayesian samplers (JAGS, Stan, ...) in a tidy data format. Also provides
    miscellaneous functions helpful for analysing tidy samples from Bayesian models, such 
    as estimates and intervals, and a ggplot2 function for easy eye plots of posteriors
    (aka raindrop plots or violin plots).

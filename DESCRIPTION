Description: Facilitates composing data for and extracting samples from Bayesian models
    (JAGS, Stan, rstanarm, brms, MCMCglmm, coda, ...) in a tidy data format. Also provides
    miscellaneous functions helpful for analysing tidy samples from Bayesian models, such 
    as functions to generate estimates and intervals, and geoms for common tasks like estimates
    with multiple intervals, eye plots (intervals plus densities), and fit curves with
    multiple, arbitrary uncertainty bands.

Description: Facilitates composing data for and extracting posterior draws from Bayesian models
    (JAGS, Stan, rstanarm, brms, MCMCglmm, coda, ...) in a tidy data format. Also provides
    miscellaneous functions helpful for analysing tidy data frames of draws from Bayesian models, such 
    as functions to generate point summaries and intervals, and geoms for common tasks like points
    with multiple uncertainty intervals, eye plots (intervals plus densities), and fit curves with
    multiple, arbitrary uncertainty bands.

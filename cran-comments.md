## Submission comments

This is the first submission to CRAN of the package `tidybayes`,
which has been available on Github for awhile and which 
I have recently solidified into a more stable, well-tested API.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R-release 3.5.1
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0

* local Windows install, R-devel 2018-07-01 r74950
* Debian Linux (rhub debian-gcc-release), R-release 3.5.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORS or WARNINGs. There was one NOTE:

> NOTE
> Maintainer: 'Matthew Kay <mjskay@umich.edu>'
> 
> New submission

As noted, this is the first CRAN submission for `tidybayes`.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies for this package.

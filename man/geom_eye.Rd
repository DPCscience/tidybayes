\title{Vertical eye plots (aka raindrop plots, aka violin plots) of densities with point
estimates and intervals for ggplot2}
\usage{
geom_eye(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "ydensity",
  position = "dodge", trim = TRUE, scale = "area", fill = "gray65",
  violin.args = list(), ..., fun.data = mean_qi, fun.args = list(),
  color = NULL, size = NULL, interval.args = list(geom = "pointrange",
  position = "identity"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link{aes}} or \code{\link{aes_string}}. Only needs to be set at the
layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{stat}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}. The statistical
transformation to use on the data for this layer.}

\item{position}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}. The position adjustment
to use for overlapping points on this layer.}

\item{trim}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}. If \code{TRUE} (default),
trim the tails of the violins to the range of the data. If \code{FALSE},
don't trim the tails.}

\item{scale}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}. If "area" (default), all
violins have the same area (before trimming the tails).  If "count", areas
are scaled proportionally to the number of observations. If "width", all
violins have the same maximum width.}

\item{fill}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}. Fill color of the violin.}

\item{violin.args}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{geom_violin}}.}

\item{fun.data}{The function used to construct point estimates and
credible intervals from the data. Should be a function that takes a vector
of data as input and returns a data frame with columns \code{y},
\code{ymin}, and \code{ymax}, representing the point estimate, lower bound
of the credible interval, and upper bound of the credible interval. See
\code{\link{point_interval}} for examples; some
typical functions to consider here are \code{\link{mean_qi}} (mean
with quantile interval), \code{\link{median_qi}} (median with quantile
interval), and \code{\link{mode_hdi}} (mode with highest density interval).
Alias for \code{fun.data}.}

\item{fun.args}{Optional arguments passed to \code{fun.data}.}

\item{color}{Passed to \code{\link{stat_summary}}. Color of the point
estimate and credible interval.}

\item{size}{Passed to \code{\link{stat_summary}}. Line weight of the point
estimate and credible interval.}

\item{interval.args}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{stat_summary}}.}
}
\description{
Generates a combination geom_violin and geom_pointrange (using stat_summary)
representing the density, point estimates, and credible interval. Useful
for representing posterior estimates from Bayesian samplers; in that context
this is variously called an eye plot, a raindrop plot, or a violin plot
(though violin plot is also applied to plots of data, hence its use is not
preferred here).
}
\details{
An eye plot is a compact visual summary of the distribution of some samples,
used (under various names and with subtle variations) to visualize posterior
distributions in Bayesian inference. This instantiation is a combination of
a violin plot, point estimate, and credible interval. \code{geom_eye()} is
equivalent to \code{geom_violin() + stat_summary()} with some reasonable
defaults, including color choices and the use of mean with 95\% quantile
intervals.

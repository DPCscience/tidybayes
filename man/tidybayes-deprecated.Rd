See `Details` for information on each deprecated function and suggested alternatives.

\details{
\code{ggeye} is deprecated: I no longer think it is good practice to design
monolithic functions that output ggplot objects; instead, it is more flexible
to design geoms and stats that can be more easily used within a complete ggplot
workflow. \code{\link{geom_eyeh}} offers a horizontal eye plot geom that can
be used instad of \code{ggeye}.

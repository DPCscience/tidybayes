\title{Deprecated functions in tidybayes}
\description{
See `Details` for information on each deprecated function and suggested alternatives.
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item \code{ggeye} is deprecated: I no longer think it is good practice to design
  monolithic functions that output ggplot objects; instead, it is more flexible
  to design geoms and stats that can used within a complete ggplot
  workflow. \code{\link{geom_eyeh}} offers a horizontal eye plot geom that can
  be used instad of \code{ggeye}.

\item \code{gather_lsmeans_samples} is a deprecated alias for \code{\link{gather_emmeans_samples}}.
  The new name (estimated marginal means) is more appropriate for Bayesian models than
  the old name (least-squares means).

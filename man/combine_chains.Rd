\title{Combine the chain and iteration columns of tidy samples}
\usage{
combine_chains(samples, chain = .chain, iteration = .iteration,
  into = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Tidy data frame of samples with columns representing the chain and iteration of each sample, such as
returned by \code{\link{as_sample_tibble}}, \code{\link{spread_samples}}, or \code{\link{gather_samples}}.}

\item{chain}{Bare name of column in \code{samples} indicating the chain of each row. The default (\code{.chain}) is
the same as returned by other functions in \code{tidybayes}.}

\item{iteration}{Bare name of column in \code{samples} indicating the iteration of each row. The default
(\code{.iteration}) is the same as returned by other functions in \code{tidybayes}.}

\item{into}{Name (as a character vector) of the column to combine chains into. The default, \code{NULL}, replaces the
\code{chain} column with \code{NA}s and writes the combined chain iteration numbers into \code{iteration}. If
provided, \code{chain} and \code{iteration} will not be modified, and the combined iteration number will be written
into a new column named \code{into}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of tidy samples with a combined iteration column
}
\description{
Combines the chain and iteration columns of a tidy data frame of samples from a Bayesian model fit by renumbering
iterations to ensure that the iteration column alone can uniquely identify each draw. Can be useful for making plots
showing multiple iterations where you do not care about differences among chains.

\examples{

library(magrittr)
library(coda)

data(line, package = "coda")

# The `line` posterior has two chains with 200 iterations each:
line \%>\%
  as_sample_tibble() \%>\%
  summary()

# combine_chains combines the chains, giving 400 iterations with
# `.chain = NA` (to indicate that the chains were combined, as opposed to
# this being 400 iterations from one chain).

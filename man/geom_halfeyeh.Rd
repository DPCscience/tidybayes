\title{Half-eye plots of densities with point estimates and intervals (ggplot geom)}
\usage{
geom_halfeyeh(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "joy",
  position = "identity", scale = 0.9, rel_min_height = 0,
  fill = "gray65", ..., point.interval = mean_qih,
  fun.data = point.interval, fun.args = list(), .prob = c(0.95, 0.66),
  color = NULL, size = NULL, fatten.interval = NULL,
  fatten.point = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link{aes}} or \code{\link{aes_string}}. Only needs to be set at the
layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{stat}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_joy}}. The statistical
transformation to use on the data for this layer.}

\item{position}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_joy}}. The position adjustment
to use for overlapping points on this layer.}

\item{scale}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_joy}}. A scaling factor to scale the
height of the densities relative to the spacing between them. A value of 1
indicates that the maximum point of any density touches the baseline right
above, assuming even spacing between baselines.}

\item{rel_min_height}{Densities at heights below this cutoff will be removed.
The cutoff is measured relative to the overall maximum, so rel_min_height=0.01
would remove everything that is 1% or less than the highest point among all
densities. Default is 0, so nothing is removed.}

\item{fill}{Passed to \code{\link{geom_joy}}. Fill color of the density.}

\item{...}{Currently unused.}

\item{point.interval}{Alias for \code{fun.data}}

\item{fun.data}{A function that is given a vector and should
return a data frame with variables \code{x}, \code{xmin} and \code{xmax}
and \code{.prob}. See the \code{point_interval} family of functions.}

\item{fun.args}{Optional arguments passed to \code{fun.data}.}

\item{.prob}{The \code{.prob} argument passed to \code{fun.data}.}

\item{color}{Passed to \code{\link{stat_summaryh}}. Color of the point
estimate and credible interval.}

\item{size}{Passed to \code{\link{stat_summaryh}}. Line weight of the point
estimate and credible interval.}

\item{fatten.interval}{A multiplicative factor used to adjust the size of the interval
lines (line size will be \code{(size + 3) * fatten.interval}. The default decreases the line size, because the
default range of \code{\link{scale_size_continuous}} has an upper end of 6, which is quite large.}

\item{fatten.point}{A multiplicate factor used to adjust the size of the point relative to the largest line.}

\description{
Generates a combination geom_joy and geom_pointrangeh (using stat_summaryh)
representing the density, point estimates, and credible interval. Useful
for representing posterior estimates from Bayesian samplers; in that context
the mirrored verison is variously called an eye plot, a raindrop plot, or a
violin plot; hence "half-eye" for this plot.
}
\details{
A half-eye plot is a compact visual summary of the distribution of some samples,
used (under various names and with subtle variations) to visualize posterior
distributions in Bayesian inference. This instantiation is a combination of
a density plot, point estimate, and credible interval. \code{geom_halfeyeh()} is
equivalent to \code{geom_joy() + stat_summaryh()} with some reasonable
defaults, including color choices and the use of mean with 95\% quantile
intervals.

See \code{\link{geom_eye}} and \code{\link{geom_eyeh}} for the mirrored-density
(full "eye") versions. See \code{\link{geom_joy}} and \code{\link{stat_summaryh}} for the geoms
this function is based on.
